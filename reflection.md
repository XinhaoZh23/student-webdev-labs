## Reflection Document

### HTML

### 01-html

I completed all the exercises independently, and referred to some online tutorials to better understand the usage of HTML tags.

This week's exercises were very helpful, especially 02-images, where using placeholder images (like placebear) gave me a more intuitive understanding of <figure> and <figcaption>. I also learned how to create common structures such as lists, images, and tables.

In 04-table, I mistakenly thought I needed to implement an interactive input box that appears on click, and spent a lot of time trying to simulate this with pure HTML. Eventually, I realized that only a static display of the "input box" appearance was required. I hope the instructions can be more explicit about this in the future.

If there could be a comprehensive exercise that requires me to use lists, images, forms, and tables all on the same page, it would help me consolidate and integrate what I learned this week even more.

### Accessibility

### 02-a11y

I completed this exercise independently, without referring to any additional tutorials or answers.

This part of the exercise was very helpful. Previously, I never paid much attention to web accessibility and only cared about the visual appearance of the page. However, through this exercise and the explanations in the notebook, I realized that for users who do not primarily rely on vision to browse the web, the hidden information and structure in a webpage are especially important. Many invisible elements can trigger alerts and errors in accessibility checks, which made me better understand the difficulties they face when using the web.

I found all the instructions in this section to be very clear and did not feel confused at any point.

If a copy of a real website's source code could be provided, requiring us to fix its accessibility issues, it would help us better understand the real user experience of different people.

### CSS

### 03-css

I completed this exercise independently, and referred to some online tutorials and resources to understand media queries and debugging methods.

This part of the exercise was very helpful. Previously, I never seriously considered how web layouts change across different screen sizes, nor did I know how to debug and adapt mobile interfaces when developing on a laptop or desktop. Now I have learned to use browser developer tools to simulate different device widths, which will be very useful for my future development.

Question 06 initially confused me. At first, I thought I needed to create separate .html and .css files for each screen size. Later, I realized that the adaptation is achieved by using media queries within a single file. This difference in understanding cost me some extra time, and I think clearer instructions would be helpful.

If there were a real website as a base template for us to modify its styles to achieve responsive adaptation, it would be closer to real development scenarios and would deepen our understanding and practical skills.

### 04-flexbox

I completed the exercises independently, without referring to any additional materials.

This part of the exercises was helpful. The second-to-last exercise, which required adjusting alignment parameters, gave me a much deeper understanding of layout.

I found all the instructions in this exercise to be very clear.

### CSS-grid

### 05-css-grid

I completed this exercise independently, and referred to some online tutorials and resources to help me understand how to use CSS Grid.

This part of the exercise was very helpful. I not only gained a clearer understanding of the differences between CSS Grid and Flexbox, but also resolved some previous confusions, such as why Flexbox cannot be used to arrange circles or geometric shapes. After realizing that Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout tool, this issue became clear. In addition, I learned how to use accessibility hiding techniques (such as `aria-hidden` and `.sr-only`) to ensure accessibility without affecting the layout, which improved my understanding of web semantic structure and user experience.

I found the instructions in this section to be very clear and did not feel that further explanation was needed.

If there could be some exercises comparing Flexbox and CSS Grid, such as implementing the same layout with both methods, it would be even more helpful for understanding their differences and best use cases in practice.
